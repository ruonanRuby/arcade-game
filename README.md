## Genera Introduction 

This is an Udacity Front-End Developer Project, with the practice of combining skills in HTML,CSS and JavaScript into a game based project. It is a great chance to practice JavaScript's object oriented programming features. At the same time, even though the visual assets and game loop engine are provided, it is still a good chance to learn their functionalities.

## How The Game Works 

Find the game at the following GitHub Project Page: [PLAY](https://ruonanruby.github.io/arcade-game/)

### Goal: let your preferred hero reaches the lake without colliding an enemy,<br />
but get as many gems and heart as you can! 

### Controls
**Use Arrow Keys to Move Your Hero**
- Left Arrow: move left
- Right Arrow: move right
- Down Arrow: move down
- Up Arrow: move up


-> The game starts once it loaded, you will have three lives and zero score at level 1. <br />
Enemies move slow and the gem at this level will not disappear until you get it!
(A sweet treat for ya!) <br />
What's more, during the game, you can change the character whenever you want! <br />
simply move the hero to the selector at right bottom, you will have a new hero without loosing
any score!

-> Reaches the lake to go next level. The Enemies will move faster. At the same time you will have a chance to get a heart for one more life and a gem to gain score. However, from this level, the gem only stays for 3 seconds, then it disappear.
